# First MC simulation using Julia 

Here i coded a simple Monte Carlo simulation - or at least I tried 4 times - in order to understand better the language itself.
Note: I learnt that functions can be defined as:

```Julia
function f( arg1 , arg2 )
  arg1 + arg2    # this is actually the return value
end
```

I also used _IJulia_ to communicate to notebooks.
